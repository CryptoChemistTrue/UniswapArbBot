# Uniswap Arbitrage Bot
Arbitrage is a way to earn in the world of DeFi with automation tools. I've created an Arbitrage Trading Bot which targets the Uniswap Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) Liquidity Pairs for arbitrage opportunities, been testing and using for over half a year and I've finally decided to release it open source.
It's super-easy to setup and you don't need any coding experience.

ðŸš¨ UPDATE: I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. If you fund the contract with 0.3 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees, so I suggest to fund at least 0.4 ETH.
